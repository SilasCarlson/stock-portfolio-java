# Overview

This project was to learn a bit of Java Syntax and how programs are developed in Java. I was trying to further my learning 
as a software engineer in order to understand how other languages work and how Java can be used to create software once, but
be cross-platform. The software here is a very basic and simple stock portfolio that can be used to mimic a stock portfolio.
You are able to buy stocks and then sell your stock portfolio into a text file and then are able to load it at a later date.
The purpose of writing this software was to help me learn a little bit of Java.
